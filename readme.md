We are going to create a random colour generator that changes the background colour of the page when a user clicks a button randomly.

A/C
Given a user is on the home page
When they click on the "Change colour botton"
They should see the background colour of the homepage change

Given a user has clicked on the button
Then the value of the colour should be displayed on the page in RGB Format

Given a user has clicked on the button
Then the value of the colour should be copied to the click board
